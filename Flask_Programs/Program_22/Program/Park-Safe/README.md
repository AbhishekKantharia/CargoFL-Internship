### CMU Course Project
**Course:** 16-791 Applied Data Science

--------------------------------------------
### Description:

Park-Safe is data-powered application which provides **real-time recommendations of safe parking spots to users in the city of San Francisco, California**. The goal of this project is to use historical vehicular crime data to analyze the time and location demographics of the incidents. The result of this analysis is encapsulated in the form of an interactive application which, provided the time and location information, evaluates the vehicle theft safety of nearby metered parking spots. We present a web-based prototype of the application
